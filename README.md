# Java Examples

Example applications that are more interesting than textbook samples, for teaching and learning ðŸ’»

## Motivation

I've accrued a selection of educational mini-projects for Java while teaching Java to high school students, and thought it would be good to share these in case other people find it useful for teaching or learning java.

These examples are not for production use. The often sacrifice performance / durability / security where sensible to instead focus on extensibility, clarity, simplicity, and suitability for an introduction to Java programming and patterns that are applicable to more than just the JVM ecosystem.

**Disclaimer**: Java is not my primary environment (JavaScript is), so there are probably occasions where I don't follow Java best practices not because it's educational, but just because I didn't know better. If you find such cases, please feel free to open a pull request with your changes.
